# Sentiment Analysis - Deep Learning Methods For Speech Recognition

Deep learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning technique that learns multiple layers of representations or features of the data and produces state-of-the-art prediction results. Along with the success of deep learning in many other application domains, deep learning is also popularly used in sentiment analysis.

### Sentiments
For better accuracy results, we decided to focus on 3 different class labels.
Each class is a combination of common emotions.
1. **Positive** - a mixture of Happy and Surprise.
2. **Neutral** - a mixture of Neutral and Calm.
3. **Negative** - a mixture of Anger, Fear, Sad, and Disgust.
